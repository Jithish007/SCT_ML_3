🐾 Task 03 – Cat vs Dog Classification using SVM

This project was completed as part of my Machine Learning Internship at SkillCraft Technology.

In this task, I developed an image classification system using Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs from a publicly available dataset.
-------------------

📌 Objective

To design and implement a machine learning model capable of accurately distinguishing between cat and dog images based on extracted visual features.
------------------

📂 Dataset

Dataset Name: Dogs vs Cats (Kaggle)

Category: Image Classification

Directory Structure Used:

PetImages/
├── Cat/
└── Dog/
-------------------------------

🔍 Key Steps Performed

Loaded and explored the image dataset

Performed image preprocessing (resizing and normalization)

Converted images into feature vectors

Assigned class labels for cats and dogs

Split data into training and validation sets

Trained a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier

Evaluated the model using accuracy metrics
------------------------------------

📊 Visualization

Prediction confidence visualization for test images
-------------------------------------

🛠 Technologies Used

Python

NumPy

OpenCV

Matplotlib

Scikit-learn
--------------------------------

🚀 Outcome

Successfully built an SVM-based classifier for cat vs dog images

Achieved reliable classification performance

Gained practical experience in image preprocessing and machine learning workflows
------------------------------------------------------------

📎 Note

Due to the large size of the dataset, it has not been included in this repository.
